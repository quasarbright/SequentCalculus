# SequentCalculus

Automates proving logic statements in the [sequent calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus)

The main algorithm accepts a formula and
outputs whether it is always true for any variable assignment
or if it is possibly false for some variable assignments

I also turned this into a sat decider (exponential time)

I also made it so it can print out the whole inference
tree in LaTeX! run Main.main for an example.

I should make a type inference algorithm which outputs the inference tree.
Would be great for explaining type inference.
